# Sammy's Portfolio
### Stuff to remember:
Production website is deployed to
[sammyis.me](https://sammyis.me)

Website is rebuilt and redeployed every time there's a commit to `master` using Netlify (I <3 Netlify)

Demo is deployed to [sammyis-gdemo.surge.sh](https://sammyis-gdemo.surge.sh) manually, via the NPM script `npm run demploy:demo`. Demo website is hosted in Surge (without any forced HTTPS, btw)

Website is built on GatsbyJS
