# Sammy's Portfolio
### Stuff to remember:
Production website is deployed to
`sammyis.me`.

Website is rebuilt and redeployed every time there's a commit to `master` using Netlify (I <3 Netlify).

Demo is deployed to `sammyis-gdemo.surge.sh` manually, via the NPM script `npm run demploy:demo`. Demo website is hosted in Surge (without any forced HTTPS, btw).

Website is built on GatsbyJS
